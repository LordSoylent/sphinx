Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon
 Sphinx is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that
 is completely decentralized and it is related to gaming, without the
 need for a central server or trusted parties.  Users hold the crypto
 keys to their own money and transact directly with each other, with 
 the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.
 Latest verssphx supports zerocoin protocol.
 .
 Full transaction history is stored locally at each client.  This
 requires 1+ GB of space, slowly growing.

 This package provides the daemon, sphxd, and the CLI tool
 sphx-cli to interact with the daemon.
